# Grid Island Builder

**Grid Island Builder** is a project developed using Unreal Engine, showcasing the creation of a grid-based island-building game. This project highlights advanced game development techniques, including grid management, procedural generation using Perlin noise, and interactive environment creation.

## Key Components

### Plugins
- **Phoinix RTS Camera Plugin:** Implements a real-time strategy camera system for better control and navigation.

### Source
- **GridManager.cpp:** Manages the grid system, including the placement and interaction of hexagonal grid tiles.
- **IslandBuilder.cpp:** Handles the procedural generation and construction of islands within the grid using Perlin noise.
- **PlayerController.cpp:** Manages player inputs and interactions with the game environment.

## Features

- **Grid-Based Building:** Implements a hexagonal grid system for placing and managing island tiles.
- **Procedural Generation:** Uses Perlin noise to dynamically generate islands and landmasses, shaping them into hexagonal instances.
- **Interactive Environment:** Allows players to interact with the grid and build their own islands.

This project serves as an excellent example for developers looking to create interactive and dynamic grid-based games using Unreal Engine.
